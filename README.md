# ydict
A CLI tool for Yahoo! dictionary (https://tw.dictionary.yahoo.com/)

This project won't be developed anymore.
I've created a new project https://github.com/M157q/zdict based on this project which is a mainly focus on being a flexible online dictionary framework.
The zdict project is written in Python 3 and based on a projec skeleton, not just one script.
