# ydict
A CLI tool for Yahoo! dictionary (https://tw.dictionary.yahoo.com/)

This project won't be developed anymore, but may be updated when the Yahoo! dictionay url changed.  
I've created a new project https://github.com/M157q/zdict based on this project which mainly focus on being a flexible online dictionary framework not only for Yahoo! dictionary.  
This new zdict project is written in Python 3 and based on a project skeleton, not just one Python script.
